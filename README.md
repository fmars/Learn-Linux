**In the past** I was occasionally blocked by some Linux operation related issues every couple months. And I solved the problems through StackOverflow but I almost never understood how it worked.

**I was planning** to dig into and learn linux knowledge each time when some linux problem blocked me. I failed because each time when I opened a wiki page to learn some new linux thing, there are ten times more new staffs emerging. So this time I'm planning to learn Linux systematically through some book or training.

**I'm trying** to find a good way to learn Linux Administration, regarding the goal and the procedure. Here are some of my experiences.
- Problem driven is always the best way to learn. Trying to solve a really problem is the best motivation. It's also trackable. Most importantly, you won't really grasp a skill until hands dirty.
- Don't set up your goal as finish reading a Linux Book. It's a wasting of time.
- LFCS course is great, from some point of view. It builds a well structured knowledge hierachy. So you'll be able to have some sense of the whole picture at very beginning. It is hard to gain such understanding from solving each individual problem especially when you're a newbie. But don't expect LFCS give you too much details or underlying mechanisms.
- The Handbook is great. It explains system principles in a convenient way. Purely reading this book without having a real problem in mind may cause losing yourself.

So having some sense of the whole picture, getting high level ideas of each component, having real world problem, digging into the details, is a nice precedure to take.
